        "Script_1_Opening_1" "Oh look at this! New blood! The dragon knight himself!"
        "Script_1_Opening_2" "Fresh from the Netflix anime are you? Welcome to the world of Dota 2! We are here to teach you how to navigate the best game ever made."
        "Script_1_Opening_3" "Except for Artifact"
        "Script_1_Opening_4" "Yes, yes, of course, except for Artifact"
        "Script_1_Opening_5" "First things first, let's take you through the main goals of the game, Defense Of The Ancients."
        "Script_1_Opening_6" "Is it to defend the Ancients by any chance?"
        "Script_1_Opening_7" "No, surprisingly, it is to kill the enemy Ancient. See, this is why you need us."
        "Script_1_Opening_8" "This is the Dota 2 map, your personal battlefield. You are currently in your fountain. It will heal you and is where you can purchase items, which are power ups for your hero."
        "Script_1_Opening_9" "This is also where you will respawn after you die, which I'm sure is coming up very soon"
        "Script_1_Opening_10" "This, all the way over here, is the enemy Ancient, this is what you are trying to destroy."
        "Script_1_Opening_11" "But we have a long way to go before that."
        "Script_1_Movement_1" "So, let's start off with baby steps. Let's get you to move. Move the cursor with your mouse and hover over this very generic tutorial type way-point."
        "Script_1_Movement_2" "That's mean, I think it looks pretty."
        "Script_1_Movement_3" "You would. Something as ugly as you would think that... BROTHER"
        "Script_1_Movement_4" "Oh my goodness his first steps! SOMEONE GRAB THE CAMERA!"
        "Script_1_Movement_5" "OK, now move on to the next step. Oh hey, it's Mirana, from the anime."
        "Script_1_Movement_6" "Actually she is a very old hero, in fact, she was in the original Dota."
        "Script_1_Movement_7" "Mirana from the anime!"
        "Script_1_Movement_8" "Anyway, she's very protective of us for some reason. Watch out for her arrows. Simply dodge them when she fires at you."
        "Script_1_Movement_9" "Generic Greeting"
        "Script_1_Movement_10" "Nice Dodging"
        "Script_1_Movement_11" "That's a good effort! Very good you are a real walking pro. Now, let's get to the hard stuff. I am going to unlock your camera now. If at any point you get lost, the F1 key will bring you back to your hero."
        "Script_1_Camera_1" "Woah woah where are you goin?! This guy's out of his mind! Reel it back in kiddo"
        "Script_1_Camera_2" "In the game of Dota, you will need to move your camera while simultaneously moving your hero to a selected spot. This is difficult to master but is step one. We will help you, but first we need to get you ready to fight if you want to survive outside of the safety of your fountain."
        "Script_1_Camera_3" "Here is a target dummy"
        "Script_1_Camera_4" "Spawn Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_5" "This is the new player that showed up yesterday! He didn't make it past the movement part. Hover your mouse over the dummy and right click him to attack!"
        "Script_1_Camera_6" "Dying Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_7" "Oh my that was very violent. Wait, why do I have a health bar over my head now?"
        "Script_1_Camera_8" "Come on you know you want too. Do it. Attack the man"
        "Script_1_Camera_9" "AUGGGGHH WHYYY WHY GOD IT HURTS"
        "Script_1_Camera_10" "JESUS WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_1" "Oh look at that you leveled up and got a ton of gold! Killing enemies, or just being in the general area of killed enemies or... I guess helpful tutorial golems allows you to gain experience and gold. Gaining experience allows you to level up, like in an RPG game. As you can see, you were already provided your third skill, Dragon Blood, which is a passive, meaning it just works. Now, you can select another skill! Let's have you select an active ability. Click on the plus sign over 'Dragon Tail'."
        "Script_1_Leveling_2" "Feel free to hover over your skills at any time, to learn more about them. Probably best not to do this during the game though as other people might laugh at you. You can also read up on all the hero skills in the heroes tab, which is in the main menu of Dota."
        "Script_1_Leveling_3" "Oh no, here comes Pugna. He's so annoying"
        "Script_1_Leveling_4" "Yellow everybody this is Pugna and I'm here to talk to you today about the difference between strength, agility, and intelligence"
        "Script_1_Leveling_5" "Oh god make him stop! Use your ability! Press the 'W' key or hover over the icon and select the skill you want to use."
        "Script_1_Leveling_6" "Good! Now hover the mouse over the enemy unit and left click it! Your hero will automatically walk toward the enemy until the spell is in range!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_7" "Please don't interrupt me. Now let me begin again."
        "Script_1_Leveling_8" "Oh no ahhh"
        "Script_1_Leveling_9" "Excellent work! I'm a ghost now by the way! Looks like you got enough exp for another level! Try putting it in your 'Breathe Fire' ability!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_10" "Your Dragon Tail is a single target ability, meaning you can target an enemy and it will cast it on them, as long as you are in range. Breathe Fire on the other hand, is a target point ability, meaning you can target a point, like a place on the map, but not specific unit."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_1" "Why do I have a health bar?"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_2" "It's your turn dear brother. you know what to do young one. Press 'Q', aka your Breathe Fire ability, or simply select it with your mouse, then click on the ground with the left mouse button in the direction you want to cast."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_3" "no NO NO"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_4" "AHHHH IT BURNS... Well I guess we are both ghosts now."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_5" "Yes both ghosts, here to haunt you for eternity. Just keep in mind that this is NOT in a normal Dota game. You will not be haunted by ghosts I promise. You know what else will haunt you? Hit the 'SHOP' button!"
        "Script_1_Shop_1" "Oh my god there are so many items! MY EYES!"
        "Script_1_Shop_2" "Items are one of the many reasons this game is so deep. A hero by default, will be good at a specific thing depending on who you pick. But items allow you to change them to excel in areas they may not be able to normally."
        "Script_1_Shop_3" "Certain items can allow you to open up completely different play-styles for your heroes. Think of Dota heroes as rock, paper, scissors. Rock will always beat scissors, but in Dota, scissors can specifically build itself to be a little better against rock, should the need arise."
        "Script_1_Shop_4" "I know there are way too many items to remember, but worry not little one, the community has made guides for every single hero, telling you what usually works well on the hero you are playing. Here is how to open them. Select this button here."
        "Script_1_Shop_5" "I made this guide for you, it's called “Items a first time Dragon Knight needs this very second”"
        "Script_1_Shop_6" "Oh very specific. Confirm that guide youngling!"
        "Script_1_Shop_7" "There you have it. Now you can just right-click on the item in your guide, and if you have the money for it the item will be bought automatically. Your gold is down in the bottom right. Congrats. I think you have enough money from murdering 3 people in the short time you arrived here, so go on ahead."
        "Script_1_Closing_1" "Ok creature of mine, it's time for you to escape this hellish prison we have designed for you. Click on the item in your inventory, just like you would a spell, and then drag it over to the tree here and select it with the left mouse. Are you starting to see a pattern?"
        "Script_1_Closing_2" "I hope so"
        "Script_1_Closing_3" "You did it! Don't ask why eating a tree is a good thing in this game, it just is. You can now escape! Go little one run before we change our minds!"
        "Script_1_Closing_4" "We are giving you back control over your camera. It's time to walk and look baby. Goodluck!"
        "Script_1_Closing_5" "Did you really think we would just let you out? NO! WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF TREES!"
        "Script_1_Closing_6" "Go baby infant! Follow this very not ominous path! Practice your moving and camera control! Keep in mind that you can move your camera in two ways. Number one is for cool people: where you middle click your mouse on the ground and hold it while dragging. Or you can be like my idiot mud golem brother, and move your cursor to the edge of the screen. All of this of course you can change in your game settings."
        "Script_2_Opening_1" "And here we are. Welcome to the top radiant barracks. Before you lay several buildings each with their own purpose and destiny."
        "Script_2_Opening_2" "Except for that one there. That's a moon well."
        "Script_2_Opening_3" "Yes, that is just there to look cool. Do you think it's cool? I do."
        "Script_2_Opening_4" "Very good. So, to your right you can see the melee barracks, and to the left you see the ranged barracks. These two buildings spawn creeps."
        "Script_2_Opening_5" "Don't worry, not creeps like people that have bodypillows. Creeps like... uh... what are creeps like?"
        "Script_2_Opening_6" "The creeps spawn every 30 seconds and walk down the path ahead of them, called a lane. The creeps are uncontrollable and have one mission, to mindlessly walk down the path and attack any enemy they come in contact with. This includes enemy heroes, buildings, or emotions!"
        "Script_2_Opening_7" "That's right. The creeps act as your cannon fodder, making sure that the enemy can't just go to your side of the map and hurt you, or they will be stabbed by a thousand little swords."
        "Script_2_Opening_8" "These barracks are what spawn these creeps, so as you can imagine if you destroy the enemy's barracks, then they will become weakened. There is one set of barracks in each of the three lanes. These lanes are referred to as top, middle and bottom."
        "Script_2_Opening_9" "Now, if you destroy the barracks, the enemy creeps don't just stop spawning. They continue to spawn, but your creeps get stronger in each lane that lacks an enemy barracks. And if you take them all, you are awarded MEGA CREEPS which are very powerful and can gang up to kill even heroes!"
        "Script_2_Opening_10" "Indeed! Think of Dota like this: killing other players allows you to have time to hit their buildings while they respawn. Hitting buildings is the true goal of Dota, for when there are no buildings the enemy Ancient is exposed. The game in a nutshell is essentially an elaborate tug of war where both sides try to outpush the other."
        "Script_2_Opening_11" "Yes. Well that technically would be the opposite of a tug of war."
        "Script_2_Opening_12" "Quiet, you!"
        "Script_2_Opening_13" "Dota is a game about creeps, and exposing things. This is actually not a joke!"

        "Script_2_Creeps_1"   "So the creeps have now connected and are fighting each other. As you can see, whenever an enemy unit dies, you will gain experience as long as you are in the general area. Whether you kill the unit or not, you will still get experience."
        "Script_2_Creeps_2"   "But in order to get gold, YOU must be the one to get the killing blow. We call this a last hit. This concept works for anything killable in Dota, including buildings."
        "Script_2_Creeps_3"   "OK, try getting the last hit on some of these creeps, with the help of our long lost Australian brother who specializes in last hit training."
        "Script_2_Creeps_4"   "Australian thing"
        "Script_2_Creeps_5"   "Depending on your hero, you can also use spells to kill creeps. Just keep in mind that this will cost you a very precious commodity. Remember, auto attacking costs you nothing, but spells typically use a resource called mana, which is your blue bar. Go ahead and kill some with Breathe Fire."
        "Script_2_Creeps_6"   "GOOD BYE MATE"
        "Script_2_Creeps_7"   "And look who we have here, an enemy hero!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_8"   "This is Sniper, you will probably see a lot of him in your games. Everyone really hates him."
        "Script_2_Creeps_9"   "Your hero Dragon Knight is a melee hero, which typically means you will be a bit tankier than ranged heroes like Sniper. But of course the downside to being melee, is you have to get closer in order to attack."
        "Script_2_Creeps_10"    "As you can see, Sniper is actually getting the last hit on some of his own creeps. Why would someone ever do such a thing?"
        "Script_2_Creeps_11"    "This is called denying. When an allied creep is at low health, you can actually attack it by hitting the 'A' key and selecting your creep. If you get the last hit then the enemy will actually get less experience. This is what separates us from the plebians over at League."
        "Script_2_Creeps_12"    "Try denying some of your creeps now."
        "Script_2_Creeps_13"    "Great, you've denied some creeps, which means Sniper is less powerful than you right now. Take advantage of this by destroying him."
        "Script_2_Creeps_14"    "Yes, do the community a favor and kill that mother fucker."

        "Script_3_Opening_1" "you made it! Welcome to the terrifying dark jungle young innocent beautiful one! On the dota map, there are three lanes. This is where most of the action takes place, as you will need to push one of these lanes, or more likely all of them, to win the game. Lanes are where creeps go, and that means it’s where the easy money and experience lies."
        "Script_3_Opening_2" "but not all things are so predictable my friend. The dark regions between the lanes, we call the jungle. Dangerous creatures spawn in the jungle in camps, where they stand guard to attack any who do them harm."
        "Script_3_Opening_3" "OK take it easy buddy, you’re gonna scare the young fiend. Neutral creeps aren’t really that strong, I mean we’re technically neutral creeps and you murdered us remember?.Anyway, friendly lane creeps provide vision, aka you can see them on your mini map. The jungle, however, is a place where you can move around unseen by your enemies as the creeps do not provide vision at all. Although keep in mind that your opponents , have the same opportunity . Now, lets introduce you to some of the local inhabitants."
        "Script_3_Opening_4" "oh crikey mate, theres a jungle creep right there in the wild."
        "Script_3_Opening_5" "Please don’t talk like that. Jungle creeps come in 4 sizes, small, medium large, and Ancients. Don’t get that confused with THE ancient of course. As you might imagine, the higher tier the jungle creeps, the bigger and stronger they are.! But the bigger they are, the more gold and experience they will provide.."
        "Script_3_Opening_6" "go ahead and mercilessly slay this camp."
        "Script_3_Opening_7" "good! Now all we need to do is wait! Jungle creeps spawn every minute. You’ll notice a clock at the top center of your screen."
        "Script_3_Opening_8" "im bored."
        "Script_3_Opening_9" "ok we will just respawn them now. But remember, every minute in the game!"
        "Script_3_Opening_10" "great! But oh dear, these weak, pathetic creeps from the small camp give so little gold and experience."
        "Script_3_Opening_11" "we could just walk to the bigger camps…"
        "Script_3_Opening_12" "no, im far to fat to do that. I have a better idea! The jungle camps respawn every 1 minute, so long as there is nothing in their spawn area. Hold the alt button to see what this spawn area looks like!"
        "Script_3_Opening_13" "see that box? You don’t want to stand in there when the in game timer reaches a minute, or you will block the spawn. Or, maybe you do want to stand in there, to block your enemies camp from spawning! Kinda down to what kind of person you are i guess."
        "Script_3_Opening_14" "now, the creeps wont spawn if something is in their way. But what if we just move these creeps out of the way, at the exact moment that they are supposed to spawn? Lets see what happens! When the game timer hits 53, I want you to attack a jungle creep, then run away. Get them to chase you and make sure you are all out of the box before the timer hits zero!"
        "Script_3_Opening_15" "ready????? Go!"
        "Script_3_Opening_16" "NO NO, TRY AGAIN. Pull at 53, then get out of the box."
        "Script_3_Opening_17" "perfection! Well done! This is what we call stacking a camp. Now you can get much more xp and gold from slaying this camp. In-fact, dota rewards you for doing this by giving the person who stacked the camp additional gold just for bothering to do this!"
        "Script_3_Opening_18" "yes, it’s an important skill for all heroes to know. SO, lets see how good you are. Slay these creeps, and then lets try it again. But this time, I want you to keep stacking the camp as many times as you can! Just like in the real game, you will need to pull the creeps earlier and earlier if you hope to stack more. The more you stack, the better gift I shall bestow upon you! And here’s someone to hype it for you. Goodluck!"
        "Script_3_Opening_19" "Guest greeting"
        "Script_3_Opening_20" "0 stacks: whoops, try again!"
        "Script_3_Opening_21" "1 stack: OD: well you still do better than the supports in my games! Here is your prize: a complement. Good job!"
        "Script_3_Opening_22" "2 stacks: OD: wow! Thats pretty impressive! Well done! Here is a ripe and delicious mango. Eat it up! You earned it! Yes this is in fact a real item in the game."
        "Script_3_Opening_23" "3 stacks:OD: ok thats...look the tutorial is supposed to be for first time players, why are you doing this? Do you think we will applaud you smurfing the new player tutorial? Take this gem of truesight and get the hell out of here."
        "Script_3_Opening_24" "excellent work! Now, go ahead and clear this camp. You can leave it for your allies in the game if you want, but be careful if you do, there's little to stop an enemy from taking them as well!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_1" "by god, is that a NEUTRAL ITEM? I don't know why I'm acting so excited, they’re not particularly rare. Neutral items are dropped only by jungle creeps. 4 of them will drop for each team based on the time of the in-game clock, There are 5 tiers to these items and they get better as the game goes on. This whole process begins at 7, minutes for tier 1 items and ends with the most powerful and game breaking neutral items, at 60 minutes!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_2" "yes, indeed! I’m sure you were thinking to yourself, there just aren’t enough items to learn! Well here you are my friend. The good news is that your inventory has 1 slot that is reserved specifically for a neutral item, so you don’t have to mix and match with what you buy during the game."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_3" "uh no, what’s this? A new jungle camp?"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_4" "KILL IT"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_5" "dear me, you have 2 neutral items now! As you can see, the 2nd neutral item went into your backpack. The backpack slots are what we call muted, meaning it’s as if you dont even have them on your hero. This is useful when your 6 item slots are full, but you still want some other items that you can swap out for. Anyway, let's send your first neutral item back to base."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_6" "here is your neutral item."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_7" "now right click on that, and select (send back to fountain)"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_8" "great! Now your allies can take the garbage you don’t want. Please drag and drop the neutral item in your backpack with the left mouse button,and put it into your neutral slot"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_9" "Congratulations! You have successfully swapped neutral items!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_10" "you stacked camps, you farmed neutrals, you returned neutrals to the fountain. You are literally better than 80% of current dota players."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_11" "ok then my little pancake. You have done so well, but it is time for you to grow up and become an adult version of whatever gender you identify as. It’s time to teach you how to kill."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_12" "Greeting"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_13" "It’s riki! The demon rat!Follow that monster!"
